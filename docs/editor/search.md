Search results are beautifully highlighted.

You can also search multiple terms in one query using `space` as delimiters, such as `Markdown plaintext`, it searches for file name or file content that contains both `Markdown` and `plaintext`.

> Full text search automatically searches sub-folders, it takes some time when you have huge amount of files.
